# QR Code Component

Hi, I'm Gracie 👋  

This is my solution to the [QR Code Component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H).  
Frontend Mentor challenges help developers practice building realistic UI components and improving layout and styling skills.

---

## Overview

This project is a simple, responsive QR code card built to closely match a provided design.  
My focus was on layout, spacing, and clean structure using modern CSS techniques.

---

## Built With
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

---

## What I Learned
- Translating a design into a clean HTML structure
- Using Flexbox for centering and layout
- Writing more concise and readable CSS
- Thinking more intentionally about responsiveness
