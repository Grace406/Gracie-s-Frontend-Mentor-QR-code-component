## My process
I started out doing the structure and then adding my styles... I got stuck trying to get to perfection, I procastinated a lot and then finally I styled the project and when t came to making it reponsive, i got stuck, I used YouTube videos and asked questions and I finally just made it responsive. 

It was a good learning process for me and I just think that when I'm doing my next challenge, I'll tackle it better and spend less time.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned


-I learnt how to use google and someother resources for my benefit.

-I learnt to always try and make my code concise

-I learnt that I shouldn't take the amount of time i did on a simple project, there was a lot of procastination on my end and It wasted a lot of my time.

```html
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="./images/favicon-32x32.png">

```
```css
.container {
      box-shadow: 0 5px 30px hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.30) ;

}
```



### Continued development


-In future projects, I want to focus more on the responsiveness and flex-box.

-I'm not completely comfortable with the respnsiveness.

-A mistake I made was the fact that when I was building at first, I just built and put in anything, not thinking of whether I was doing the design for mobile or desktop etc. Then when it came to making the project responsive, I got confused and I would pick up my laptop and be stuck for hours trying to make it responsive.
